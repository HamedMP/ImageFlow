# Notice - This version of imageflow is no longer under maintenance and major update is required.

# ImageFlow
A simple wrapper of TensorFlow for Converting, Importing (and Soon, Training) Images in tensorflow.

Installation:
```
pip install imageflow
```

Usage:

```python
import imageflow
```

#### Convert a directory of images and their labels to `.tfrecords`
Just calling the following function will make a `filename.tfrecords` file in the directory `converted_data` in your projects root(where you call this method).

```python
convert_images(images, labels, filename)
```

The `images` should be an array of shape `[-1, height, width, channel]` and has the same rows as the `labels`

#### Read distorted and normal data from `.tfrecords` in multi-thread manner:
```python
# Distorted images for training
images, labels = distorted_inputs(filename='../my_data_raw/train.tfrecords', batch_size=FLAGS.batch_size,
                                      num_epochs=FLAGS.num_epochs,
                                      num_threads=5, imshape=[32, 32, 3], imsize=32)

# Normal images for validation
val_images, val_labels = inputs(filename='../my_data_raw/validation.tfrecords', batch_size=FLAGS.batch_size,
                                    num_epochs=FLAGS.num_epochs,
                                    num_threads=5, imshape=[32, 32, 3])
```
